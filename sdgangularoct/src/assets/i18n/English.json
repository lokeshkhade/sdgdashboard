        "Title1": "CHHATTISGARH MAP",
        "Para1": "The history of the Chhattisgarh region dates back to about the 4th century CE, when it was known as Southern (or South) Kosala. The name Chhattisgarh, meaning “thirty-six forts,” was formerly applied to the territory of the Haihaya dynasty of Ratanpur, founded about 750. Under British rule the present region of Chhattisgarh consisted of a division comprising 14 feudatory princely kingdoms under the Eastern States Agency. Raipur was the headquarters of that division.",
        "Para2": "Within the Republic of India, Chhattisgarh was part of Madhya Pradesh until November 1, 2000. Although the campaign for Chhattisgarh statehood began in earnest only in the 1970s, its roots go back to the early 20th century, when local leaders began to claim a distinct cultural identity for the region. In the early 1990s the push for statehood was manifested in the election platforms of various political parties, and promises of a separate state were again prominent during the elections of 1996 and 1998. In August 2000 the Indian legislature passed the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Bill to create Chhattisgarh. The formation of Chhattisgarh was especially noteworthy in that it was peaceful; it was not associated with any of the agitation and violence that marred the establishment of two other new states—Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand) and Jharkhand—about the same time."
